I used PySimpleGui.

To run this program I create two new procedures, addClientEntry and getClientsWorkouts. 
getClientsWorkouts joins the clients table and their respective workout. 
This table gets called from the Clients_dal and the gui calls the Clients_bll. 
The table can be seen in the gui Refresh Table button. 
The form to add a client calls the new procedure and can successfully add a client entry with the appropriate fields and can be seen
in the database..
